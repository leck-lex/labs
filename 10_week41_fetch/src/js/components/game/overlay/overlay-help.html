    <p><em>Beat the NORAD supercomputer WOPR (War Operation Plan Response) and prevent global thermonuclear war!</em>

    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>War is a 2-player game. The goal is to collect the full deck to win the game.</p>
    <p>It uses a 52-card deck, divided equally among the players. They must stack their cards face down in front of
        them.
        Then, each player turns up a card at the same time. The one with the highest number wins and can add the two
        cards
        to the bottom of their stack.</p>
    <p>If it is a draw, then it is war! Each player draws a card from their stack and places it face down on the table.
        Then
        they turn up a card from the stack. The player who wins gets to collect the cards that led to war, the cards
        that
        went to “battle” and the ones facing down (6 cards in total).</p>
